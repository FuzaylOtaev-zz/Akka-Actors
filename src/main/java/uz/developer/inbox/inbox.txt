An Inbox is an actor-like object which is interrogated from the outside.
It contains an actor whose reference can be passed to other actors as
usual and it can watch other actors’ lifecycle.

When writing code outside of actors which shall communicate with actors, the ask pattern can be a solution,
but there are two things it cannot do: receiving multiple replies
and watching other actors’ lifecycle.
